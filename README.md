# Knotted Proteins Experiments

1) [**DistilProtBert** finetuning](fine-tuning/): [DistilProtBert](https://huggingface.co/yarongef/DistilProtBert) model fine-tuned only 1/2 epoch on SPOUT (*SPOUT_knotted.csv*) vs. Rossmann (*Rossmann.csv*) families, uploaded to [ðŸ¤— Hub](https://huggingface.co/simecek/knotted_proteins_demo_model) and tested on several other families 

2) [**ProtBertBFD** embeddings](tsne-visualization/): we have calculated [ProtBertBFD](https://huggingface.co/Rostlab/prot_bert_bfd) protein-level embeddings for on SPOUT and Rossmann families, got t-SNE visualizations and trained a small CNN classifier (accuracy >0.997)

3) **Interpretability**: we are working on BERT-like transformers interpretability, i.e. which part of the sequence contributed to the decision, it is still [a work in progress](https://github.com/ML-Bioinfo-CEITEC/cDNA-pretraining/tree/main/experiments/interpretability)
